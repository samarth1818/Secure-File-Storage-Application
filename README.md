# Secure File Storage Application
This is a console based application for file encryption/decryption (Fall 2017 project). 
This application tests the implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) from the NIST standard document, which is used as a pseudorandom permutation (PRP) in Cipher Block Chaining mode of encryption/decryption.

## Directions
The secure key is encrypted and stored in the file "SecureKey.bin". Please make sure that this file is saved at the same location as the executable.

### Note
This project is created to understand the use of AES in practice. It is not meant to be used inside a cryptographic module.
